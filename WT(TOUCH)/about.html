                <p>Every month, 111 million academics, professionals,
                    and students peruse the 47 million papers uploaded on Touch,
                 a platform dedicated to the dissemination of academic research.</p>

                <h1> Our Story </h1>
                <p>
    The concept for Touch originated from the experiences of its founder,
    during his  studies in bit at University of Rwanda.
    As he neared the completion of his studies,
    he recognized the need for a platform where scholars could easily showcase their identity,research interests,
    and academic contributions.
    <p>At that time, setting up a personal homepage required technical skills,
        as individuals had to write HTML code and manually upload files to the server.</p>
    <p>the founder envisioned a user-friendly solution that would streamline this process with just one click,
    making it accessible to all academics regardless of technical expertise.
    Upon sharing his idea with fellow graduate students,
    they echoed his sentiments, affirming the demand for such a platform</p>
                <h1>MISSION</h1>
                <p>The mission of Touch is to accelerate the worldâ€™s research.
                Our goal is to speed up research in every domain - finding a solution to climate change;
                finding cures for diseases; evolving artificial intelligence.
    We want to accelerate research in all these fields, and others too.</p>
